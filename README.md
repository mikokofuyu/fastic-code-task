# Fastic Code Task

## Hooks

Custom hooks were utilised to separate the logic and presentational aspects of the code.

## Tailwind

Tailwind was used as when coupled with the intellisense plugin for VSCode it enables for the quick creation of beautiful UI.

Tailwind provides a multitude of utility classes that allow us to easily style components without needing to consider overhead of estabilishing a class naming pattern such a BEM.

The tailwind config is simple to customise, allowing for additional styles to be added manually and also allows specific features to be disabled.

## TypeScript

Ensures data passed to components, function etc are type safe, encourages best practises.

When used in VSCode enables for easier code completions as IDE knows what props to expect on each component etc.

## ViteJS

ViteJS consists of two major parts:

- A dev server that serves your source files over native ES modules, with rich built-in features and astonishingly fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

## Yarn

Much faster than NPM from my experience but mainly a personal preference
